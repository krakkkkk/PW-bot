# PW-bot

you need pymongo for this to work

so pip install pymongo and then everything should work

You also need your accounts coid and token, im pretty sure you can get them from the registry but idk

my discord is krak#7305 ask only valid questions

this is something i made when i was bored and i have no use for it anymore

please share what you make with this i would love to see it!

also help improve this if someone can add threading for multiple bot support that would be awesome because I'm terrible with python.
